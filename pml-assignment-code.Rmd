#Assignment write-up

First I am going to load libraies that will be used

```
library(randomForest)
```

Then I load the training data set.

```
data_train <- read.table(file='pml-training.csv', header=T, sep=',', na.strings = c("NA","#DIV/0!"))
str(data_tran)
```

At first glance there are many variables that contain N/A values, so I leave out all, that have more than 100 missing values. I also remove first 7 variables that serve for the case identification purpose. The aim of the model is to predict activity class from device data, these variables are obsolete outside data exploration.

```
keep <- c()
for (i in 1:160){
  if (length(which(is.na(data_train[,i])))<100){keep <- c(keep,i)}
}

data_clean <- data_train[,keep[8:length(keep)]]
```

Since there are more than 19000 observations in the data, I will simply split the dataset into two parts - training for model building (60%) and testing for model evaluation (40%).

```
set.seed(123)
index_train <- createDataPartition(y=data_clean$classe,p=0.6,list=F)
train <- data_clean[index_train,]
test <- data_clean[-index_train,]
```
First thing I try is the randomForrest algorithm as this is a classification problem. I do not do any further pre-processing of the variables because this algorithm does not require it. The first model is built on the training set.
```
modelFit <- randomForest(classe~.,data=train)
modelFit$confusion
```

After careful examination of the confusion matrix it seems that the very first model has very reasonable accuracy of over 99%. SO I run the model on the remaining 40% of the data to evaluate its out of sample error, which seems to be well below 0.5%. This kind of accuracy for this model should be expected for all data collected in similar manner. I consider the model accurate enough for purposes of activity class prediction so I will not be trying more complicated algorithms.
```
pred <- test$classe==predict(modelFit,test[,-53])
table(pred)
as.numeric(table(pred)[1]/(table(pred)[1]+table(pred)[2]))
```
Finally, I run the model on the 20 test cases to submit for the second part of the assignment.
```
data_test <- read.table(file='pml-testing.csv', header=T, sep=',', na.strings = c("NA","#DIV/0!"))
datat_clean <- data_test[,keep[8:length(keep)]]
pred_test <- predict(modelFit,datat_clean[,-53])
```
